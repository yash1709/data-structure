// What is Time Complexity ?
// ---> Time Complexity is the study of the efficiency of algorithms.It tells us how much time is taken by an algorithm to process a given input.
// As the file size grows, the time taken to send the data onlinr increases linearly - O(n) while the time taken by sending it physically remains constant O(1).
