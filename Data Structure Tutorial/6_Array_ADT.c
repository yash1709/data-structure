/*

Suppose we want to build an array as an abstract data type with our customised set of values and customised set of operations in a heap.
Let's name this customised array ---> myArray.
Let our set of values which will represent our customised array include these parameters :
    * total_size ---> This stores the total reseerved size of the array in the memory location.
    * used_size ---> This stores the size of the memory location used.
    * base_address ---> This is the pointer that stores the address of the first element of the array.
and the operations include operators namely,
    * max()
    * get(i)
    * set(i, num)
    * add(another_array)
