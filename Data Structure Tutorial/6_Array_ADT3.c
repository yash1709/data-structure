// Operations on arrays in Data Structures : Traversal , Insertion , Deletion and Searching
/*
An array supports the following operations :
    * Traversal
    * Insertion
    * Deletion
    * Search

1) Traversal :
    Visiting every elements of an array once is known as traversing the array.

    WHY TRAVERSAL ?
    for use cases like :
    * Storing all elements --> Using scanf()
    * Printing all elemments --> Using printf()
    * Updating elements

An array can be easily traversed using FOR loop in C language.


2) INSERTION :
    An element can be inserted in an array at a specific position.


3) DELETION :
    An element  at a specified position can be deleted , creating a void that needs to be fixed by shifting all the elements to their adjacent left.


4) SEARCHING :
    Searching can be done by traversing the array until the element to be searched is found.

5) SORTING :
    Sorting means arranging an array in an ordely fashion (ascending or descending).
